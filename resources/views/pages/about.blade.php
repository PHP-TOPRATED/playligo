        <p>So, imagine it’s a Friday night and you’re hanging out with your friends or family. The subject of a holiday pops up. Eyes light up, and some fun (and perhaps not so fun) possible destinations are thrown into the hat. Banter ensues, past experiences are shared but in the end, a consensus doesn't materialise. Months fly by and you’re slogging away at the office at 1am In the morning.</p>
        <p>We’ve all been there. Whilst the idea of packing up and hitting the road sure sounds appealing, the research and effort needed, probably isn’t. </p>
        <p>Enter Playligo, a free travel visualization tool to help you out. Instead of having to trawl the internet for ideas or having to sieve through piles of guides and reviews, we’re making it super easy for you to decide on a getaway destination. </p>
